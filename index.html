              Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
              Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
              easy.

              >The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
              really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to
              be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
              junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
              personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
              and amazing people.</q

            <q class="faded-text"
              >Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
              needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
              program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
              were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
              The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
              learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
              have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
              example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
              job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend!</q
